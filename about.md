<h1>Christopher Zhu</h1>
<h2>Computer science and linguistics student by day, travel hacker by night. </h2>

<p>
Hello and thanks for visiting my site. I feel like I can express myself a lot better now that I'm not limited by the 1-2 lines of text allowed on LinkedIn. 
	
My name is Chris, and I'm a computer science and linguistics student at the Univesrity of Toronto. *gasp* as if you haven't seen it all around the site and on my resume. </p>

<br>
<b>Tell me a little bit about yourself.</b>

<i>If this were an interview...</i>
<p>
	Hi, my name is Chris, I'm a 4th year computer science student who's double majoring in computer science and linguistics. I'm double majoring because I'm very curious and intrigued by how we can turn speech, text, and natural language data into actionables through analytics. 
	Because of this, I worked at Nexxt Intelligence for 8 months as an intern, where we built a NLP-trained chatbot for market research. It's been used by 60,000 people around the world for more than 20 research projects. My role was designing and implementing backend algorithms using Python (and its libraries) as well as creating a frontend interface to sort responses into different categories (using React TypeScript). 
	I'm very passionate about the NLP field, but I'm also curious to try out all kinds of SWE roles in computer science. I'm a (broken) comb shaped engineer, meaning I'm basically a breadth-first person; I've learnt a little about a lot of topics, but haven't learnt a lot about specific topics. As a result, I'm a fast-learner (I learned React in just a month <i>while</i> building a project for my co-op!). 
</p>


<i>If we're getting coffee...</i>

<p>My name is Chris, I'm a... no. I'll tell you something interesting about myself that's not on my résumé (fancy accent aigu, by the way). Yes, everyone tells you that they love to travel, but I'll do you one better: you can give me some places you want to go, and I can plan a trip for you, in business / first class, for pennies-on-the-dollar using frequent flier points and miles. No seriously... how does round-trip Toronto to Taipei in business class for $50 sound? New York to Singapore on Singapore Airlines for $10? What about Toronto to Vancouver for $50 during peak season? </p>

<br>
<b> Why did you get started with computer science?</b>

<p>Long story. I've always loved messing around with tech since I was very young, and at some point I realized that I was different from a lot of my peers: I didn't like computer games; I like the computer itself. My favourite app on my old iPod touch was the "settings" app, since I got to tinker with the different cool features that people usually don't notice. 

I started programming in Java in high school, but there was always the <i>I know how to program, but what should I do with it?</i> problem. I went to volunteer at a summer camp in China for one summer; my main goal was to teach English, but I thought, why not write a program that teaches kids how to type the alphabet? So with my basic <code>System.out.println()</code> and <code>System.in.readln()</code> functions in hand, I wrote a little Java applet that asked kids to type  out every letter of the alphabet, increasing the difficulty by setting a time limit. 

<i>"Well, that was fun,"</i> I thought to myself as I came home on a non air-conditioned bus from rural Shanghai. So I literally took those two things to the test and started pursuing a degree in computer science and linguistics. </p>

<br>

<b> What are your strengths and weaknesses? </b>
<p>
	I really like this question. My strength is being able to explain difficult concepts in a simplified manner. I think this is because I read Reddit a lot and love how "tl;dr"s work. For example, "spend $1000 and get 25,000 Membership Rewards points and get a first year rebate"? What the hell does that mean? tl;dr -> you put $1000 on the card, pay it off, and you get enough for a round-trip in North America. You also only get charged the annual fee on the second year. Bam.
	<br>
	My biggest weakness is sometimes I don't pay enough attention to detail. If you hit me with <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/">LC 200</a>, I can immediately tell you that it's a search question and you can use DFS or BFS, but I might miss some edge cases for boundary checking; this actually cost me quite a few job opportunities. I'm trying to fix this by literally coming up with edge case examples every time I write code.

<h2> Introspection Time </h2>

<p> Thanks for even considering to come here! If you're reading this, either you're a friend of mine who's curious as to what I've been up to (hi Patrick!), or I've somehow become quite famous and people are actually interested in me. Isn't it funny that the recruiting process lacks a human touch? I've had quite a few companies that have given me final rounds without even having to speak to a human; it's just OA -> OA ->  final.

<b>Tell me about yourself in a way that you'd use to describe yourself </b>
<p>
	In North Burnaby I was born and raised, 
	<br>
	moved to Shanghai and that's where I spent most of my days, 
	<br>
	chillin out, made some friends, it's all cool,
	<br>
	and thinking I'd be living in China all the way through, 
	<br>
	when my parents wanted me to come back home, 
	<br>
	moved back to Burnaby where I was all alone! 
	<br>
	I did five years of high school, time to move, 
	<br>
	and now I'm living out in Toronto so I guess that's cool.
	<br>
</p>

<b>Did I want to become a computer scientist all the time?</b>
<p>
	Well duh, I wanted to be a lyrical miracle.
	<br>
	I'd be lying if I said I never considered a writing career, though. I've always been intrigued by reading and writing. There's this quote that sums it all up for me: "I can't believe that I'm feeling all this, but to you it's just words." Creative reading and writing hasn't been my forte but has always been an interest of mine; I think I might actually go take up a lesson on this sometime. 
</p>

<b>Do you actually travel for so cheap?</b>
<p>Yes! Read my blog!</p>

<b>So where is Toronto? Is it really cold because it's in Canada?</b>
<p>
	I'm not even kidding; quite a few recruiters (the majority from the US, by the way) have actually asked me this before. Toronto is in Ontario, Canada, right above New York. It's pronounced "Tron-oh"; imagine someone asking you if you've seen that cool sci-fi movie with the bikes, and you're like "oh, that one!" There you go. 
	Is it cold? I don't know, I'm so used to it. In the winter, we go down to around -30 ºC (-22 Freedom units) and in the summer we get up to like 35 ºC (again, 95 Freedom units). Not as cold as other parts of Canada (kek, Alberta), but also not the best weather. 
</p>

<b>What are some hobbies of yours?</b>
<p>
	Apart from coding, travel hacking, and reading / writing, I enjoy making coffee, listening to Taylor Swift, and long road trips by the ocean or in the mountains. Check out my piece about my PCH road trip!
