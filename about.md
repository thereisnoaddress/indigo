<h1>Christopher Zhu</h1>
<h2>Computer science and linguistics student by day, travel hacker by night. </h2>

<p>
Hello and thanks for visiting my site. I feel like I can express myself a lot better now that I'm not limited by the 1-2 lines of text allowed on LinkedIn. 
	
My name is Chris, and I'm a computer science and linguistics student at the Univesrity of Toront. *gasp* as if you haven't seen it all around the site and on my resume. 

<b> Why did you get started with computer science?</b>

Long story. I've always loved messing around with tech since I was very young, and at some point I realized that I was different from a lot of my peers: I didn't like computer games; I like the computer itself. My favourite app on my old iPod touch was the "settings" app, since I got to tinker with the different cool features that people usually don't notice. 

I started programming in Java in high school, but there was always the <i>I know how to program, but what should I do with it?</i> problem. I went to volunteer at a summer camp in China for one summer; my main goal was to teach English, but I thought, why not write a program that teaches kids how to type the alphabet? So with my basic <code>System.out.println()</code> and <code>System.in.readln()</code> functions in hand, I wrote a little Java applet that asked kids to type  out every letter of the alphabet, increasing the difficulty by setting a time limit. 

<i>"Well, that was fun,"</t> I thought to myself as I came home on a non air-conditioned bus from rural Shanghai. So I literally took those two things to the test and started pursuing a degree in computer science and linguistics. 

<b>How did it work out for you?</b>

I mean, I'm definitely still at the start of my journey. School teaches a lot of theoretical information (both computer science and linguistics) so I'm very eager to take it to the test and see what it's actually like.
